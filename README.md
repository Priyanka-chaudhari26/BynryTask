# Objective:
Develop a web application using Angular or React that allows users to view profiles and explore their addresses interactively on a map.

# Key Functionalities:
## Profile Display:

Show a list of profiles with name, photo, and a brief description.
Interactive Mapping:

Here we were supposed to include a map component to display geographic locations of profile addresses interactively. But for integrating google maps API we need a paid API Key. It's not possible to integrate paid API key right now. 


## User-Friendly Experience:

Ensure smooth navigation and intuitive interaction with profiles and maps.

## Profile Data Management:

Admin panel/dashboard for adding, editing, and deleting profiles.
## Search and Filter:

Enable users to search or filter profiles by name, location, or other criteria.
## Responsive Design:

Make the application mobile-friendly and accessible across devices.

## Profile Details View:

Provide a detailed view of each profile with additional information like contact details and interests.
